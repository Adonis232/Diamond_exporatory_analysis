Here is my module 2 project, we are making a data visualization of a dataset downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds) about a series of diamonds and their characteristics, so we can use them in the future for ML.


## Derivable 

My dashborad its updated to my [Tableau public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/emmanuel.adonis.lafuente.ramos#!/vizhome/module-2projectdatavisualization/colorclarityxyz), were I made a dashboard to look at the(overall) main characteristics that defined the price or value of a diamond.


## Configuration

In my case I had to use 2 different computers to make the project since I have Linux native on my laptop, so either we have a dual booting pc or a virtual engine to being able to use Tableau.


Multiple libraries were used:


*Matplotlib
*Seaborn
*Pandas
*Numpy
*Tableau
*Cufflinks
*Plotly
*Ipython
*Mpl toolkits


## Concepts and Knowledge

Since Im far from an expert and my knowledge of diamonds is limited, I used this website ![](#https://www.bluenile.com/education/diamonds) to get to know the dataset.


## Usage

I encountered various problems, lots of them related to not really understanding the characteristics of the diamonds.
While developing my Jupyter I had problems when making the interactive plots and 3D plots maybe because of mt computational power or the ammount of data I'm passing those libraries.


## To do

The dashboard needs improvement speacilly visually, since it looks like a beta project, and further classification.
